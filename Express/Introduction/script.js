//  Express Is a Node JS Frame Work       

/*Sure! Here's the difference between a framework and a library in simple terms:

### Library
- **What it is**: A collection of code you can use to perform specific tasks.
- **How it works**: You call the library's functions when you need them.
- **Example**: Think of it like a toolbox. You pick the tool you need when you need it.

### Framework
- **What it is**: A structure or platform for building applications.
- **How it works**: The framework provides the overall structure and calls your code at the appropriate times.
- **Example**: Think of it like a skeleton. You build your application by adding to this structure.

### Key Difference
- **Control**:
  - **Library**: You are in control and decide when to use the library.
  - **Framework**: The framework is in control and tells your code when to run.

### Simple Examples
- **Library**: If you need to do a specific task, like make an HTTP request, you might use the `requests` library in Python.
- **Framework**: If youâ€™re building an entire web application, you might use the Django framework in Python, which provides a lot of the structure and components you need.
